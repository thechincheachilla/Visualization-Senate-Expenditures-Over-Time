Project created for CSE 442 AU2021 Data Visualization
This project seeks to help people understand how much money goes towards
senatorial campaigns which are often overshadowed by presidential campaigns. 
This exploratory visualization aims to show how much spending has increased
over the years, notably, after the 2010 Citizen's United Supreme Court case.
